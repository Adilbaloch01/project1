  <p>Bedsheets are essential components of bedding, 
    typically consisting of three main types: fitted sheets, 
    flat sheets, and pillowcases. Fitted sheets are designed
    to cover the mattress snugly, while flat sheets serve as
    a top layer for comfort. Pillowcases are used to encase pillows.</p>

            When it comes to bedsheet fabrics, various materials are 
            commonly used, including cotton, polyester, bamboo, and silk.

             softness, and durability. Regulations often focus on labeling, 
             flammability standards, and the use of chemicals in bedding
